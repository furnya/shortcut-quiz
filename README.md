# Shortcut Quiz

Shortcut Quiz is a web-based application designed to help users learn and practice keyboard shortcuts interactively. It is particularly useful for developers and power users who want to improve their productivity by mastering keybindings.

## Features

- Interactive quiz to test your knowledge of keyboard shortcuts.
- Real-time feedback on correct and incorrect key presses.
- Support for multi-step keybinding sequences.
- Visual hints for keyboard shortcuts.
- Progress tracking and completion summary.

## How It Works

1. The application displays a question asking for the shortcut of a specific command.
2. Users can type the shortcut using their keyboard.
3. The app provides feedback on whether the input is correct or incorrect.
4. Users can reveal the correct answer or proceed to the next question.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shortcut-quiz.git
   ```
2. Open the `src/quiz_editor2.html` file in a modern web browser.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the quiz.

## Development

This project uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for rendering and is designed to integrate with Visual Studio Code extensions. To modify or extend the functionality:

1. Edit the `src/quiz_editor2.html` file.
2. Use the browser's developer tools to debug and test changes.
3. Reload the file in the browser to see updates.
